## Introduction

This hands-on lab is designed to equip you with practical experience in deploying, configuring, and managing Check Point’s CloudGuard Web Application Firewall (WAF). Whether you're enhancing your cloud security posture or evaluating advanced threat protection capabilities, this guide will walk you through the essential steps to secure your cloud-native applications and APIs.

Throughout this lab, you will explore how CloudGuard WAF helps safeguard your workloads against sophisticated threats such as injection attacks, data exfiltration, and automated bot abuse. You’ll gain insight into the core features and functionalities that make CloudGuard WAF a powerful solution for cloud security:

- Web Application Protection: Prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 threats by blocking malicious traffic.
- API Security: Enforce strict security policies and validate API traffic to protect against misuse and unauthorized access.
- Bot Management: Detect and mitigate harmful bot activity to maintain application performance and availability.
- Custom Rules: Define tailored security policies to meet the unique requirements of your applications and business logic.

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to help you activate protection for supported applications, configure security policies, and generate actionable reports. You’ll also learn how to access and navigate the Infinity Portal to manage your WAF deployment effectively.
By the end of this lab, you’ll be well-prepared to evaluate CloudGuard WAF in a real-world context. We encourage you to request a full Proof of Value (PoV) to explore the solution’s full capabilities in your production environment.
